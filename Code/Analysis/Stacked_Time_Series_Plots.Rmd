```

 - Create stacked time series plots from long term logger data (DO logger, level logger, and temperature logger) and connectivity data.

Clear the workspace and close all graphic devices (two right panels in RStudio).  Bring in necessary packages.

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
graphics.off()
library(ggplot2)
```
