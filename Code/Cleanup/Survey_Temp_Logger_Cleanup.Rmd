Cleanup of HOBO Survey Temperature Loggers (white loggers)

Trimming (cutting off rows where logger was not in water)

Clear the workspace and close all graphic devices (two right panels in RStudio).  Bring in the tidyverse package.

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
graphics.off()
library(tidyverse)
```

Check the working directory and change if needed.

```{r}
getwd()
```
Read in the .csv with logger data for each survey

AA James Brown Slough ()

```{r}
AA_Survey_Temp_06092021 <- read.csv("..\\..\\Data\\Raw Data\\Survey Temperature Logger Data\\21099530_06092021_AA_James_Brown_Slough.csv")
```

Make sure that the DateTime is reading the seconds.

```{r}
head(AA_Survey_Temp_06092021)
