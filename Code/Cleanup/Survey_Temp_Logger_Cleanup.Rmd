Cleanup of HOBO Survey Temperature Loggers (white loggers)

Trimming (cutting off rows where logger was not in water)

Clear the workspace and close all graphic devices (two right panels in RStudio).  Bring in the tidyverse package.

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
graphics.off()
library(tidyverse)
```

Check the working directory and change if needed.

```{r}
